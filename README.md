Use the left click button on the mouse to select a space on the grid. If you hit a _bomb_, you lose‚ùå.     

The numbers on the board represent how many bombs are adjacent to a square.   
For example, if a square has a "3" on it, then there are 3 bombs next to that square.   
The bombs could be _above, below, right left, or diagonal_ to the square.   

Avoid all the bombs and expose all the empty spaces to win Minesweeper.
